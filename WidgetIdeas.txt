Space Team had:
* buttons
* toggle buttons
* toggle switches
* sliders
* dials
* radio buttons
* grouped buttons

There were also a few special events like the wormhole or asteroid.
Panels would also swing or become covered in goo.

Some ideas to go with a medical theme depending on how wacky we want to go:
* Press and hold button: (plug the artery, charge the defibrilator)
* Rub ointment on a rash. (Could paint on a canvas and detect pixel count easily)
* Shave the region (opposite of rub ointment).
* Stitch a cut (is a zig zag motion too hard to detect or non-intuitive?)
* Pump a bellows.
* Rhythmic tapping. (like CPR maybe)
* Swipe to downward to make an incision, swipe up to close.
* Heart to do CPR on.
* Tap pills.
* Slider for syringe.
* Amputate or slice motion.


SPecific widgets to implement:
* -- Press and hold to charge defibrilator.
* -- Press and hold to plug the artery.
* -- Pump a bellows with a meter.
* Rhythmic tapping for CPR.
* -- Chest incision.
* Tap Pills.
* Slide and hold for "Clear"
* Rub ointment.
* Slider for syringe.
* Pick the nose.
* Press and hold to tickle the toes.
