Space Team had:
* buttons
* toggle buttons
* toggle switches
* sliders
* dials
* radio buttons
* grouped buttons

There were also a few special events like the wormhole or asteroid.
Panels would also swing or become covered in goo.

Some ideas to go with a medical theme depending on how wacky we want to go:
* Press and hold button: (plug the artery, charge the defibrilator)
* Rub ointment on a rash. (Could paint on a canvas and detect pixel count easily)
* Stitch a cut (is a zig zag motion too hard to detect or non-intuitive?)
* Pump a bellows.
* Rhythmic tapping. (like CPR maybe)
* Swipe to downward to make an incision, swipe up to close.
